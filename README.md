# Shape Wars
## About
Shape Wars is an 80s synthwave themed endless shooter.
## Requirements
Runs best on Chrome in full-screen (with the sound turned up). Requires a keyboard to play. Fullscreen not currently supported on Safari. Firefox performance is sub-obtimal and tends to run at a lower frame-rate affecting gameplay. If you're on a Microsoft browser then good luck.
## Gameplay
The objective of the game is to stay alive for as long as possible and to collect as many points as you can. Your character is a triangle. Points are affected by:
* Collecting a circle +5 POINTS
* Firing your laser -1 POINT
* Hitting a square -5 POINTS
Collecting a triangle gives an extra life (up to a maxiumum of 6). 'Hero Mode' generates additional squares but also gives double (+10 POINTS) for circles.
## Controls
* LEFT-ARROW/RIGHT-ARROW KEYS - Moves the triangle left / right.
* SPACEBAR - Fires the laser.
* P KEY - Pauses/unpauses the game.
* R KEY - Resets the game.
* F KEY - Fullscreen move (ESC to exit).
* A KEY - Apocalypse theme.
* S KEY - Toggle sound on/off.
